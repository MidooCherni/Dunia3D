                Broadcasting concatenated update array to all players: Client on receiving this array, loops through it and compares it to
                    oldarray. If oldarray has a unit where there should be a 0 prefabid, declare that unit's death. If oldarray has a 0  
                    where there should be a prefabid, go through the motions of creating it. If they're the same, update positions.

                Spell queue system: When a melee timer or spellcast ends, it is added to a spell_queue array in the form of [spellid]_[tar]
                    and the queue_counter count is increased. If queue_counter > 0, this array is formatted and sent along with the second
                    client to server communication, then the array is cleared and the counter reset. If queue_counter = 0, send 'n'.
                    The melee timer cannot reset to 0 after reaching cooldown, nor can is_casting and the spellcast counter reset to 
                    zero until the second server to client communication announcing '1' to declare that a received queue was treated. 
                    Otherwise it continuously sends '2', to signal that it's waiting.
